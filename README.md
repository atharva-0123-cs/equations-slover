# Equation Solver using AI

A simple tool that allows you to input an equation or formula, and it sends the data to an AI that attempts to solve it!

## Functionalities ‚ú®

- [x] Input an equation or formula
- [x] Modify or undo an input
- [x] Clear all inputs
- [x] Customize font size and color
- [x] Submit an equation
- [x] Display solution
- [x] Simple responsiveness

- [x] Dark Mode for better accessibility

## How it works üîç

This app is a frontend client for an AI-powered equation solver API created and maintained by [Arekushi](https://github.com/Arekushi). The goal is to make it easy for users to input various equations and formulas, and the AI will attempt to solve them.

Relevant formulas, laws, and concepts:
- Algebraic equations (e.g., quadratic, linear equations)
- Geometry theorems (e.g., Pythagoras theorem)
- Newton's laws of motion
- Chemical reaction balancing rules
- Matrix operations (for solving systems of equations)

Here is the link for the APIs:
- [Node API](https://github.com/Arekushi/char-recognizer-nodejs)
- [Flask API](https://github.com/Arekushi/char-recognizer-flask) (Focused on solving equations)

## How to run üöÄ

It's simple to run; you will only need Node with npm or yarn installed and a web browser.

#### Clone this repo

#### Then in the root of the project

This will install everything needed to run.

#### Finally, npm run dev 

Access http://localhost:3000 to see the result!

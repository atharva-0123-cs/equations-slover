## Functionalities ‚ú®

- [x] Input an equation or formula
- [x] Modify or undo an input
- [x] Clear all inputs
- [x] Customize font size and color
- [x] Submit an equation
- [x] Display solution
- [x] Simple responsiveness 
- [x] Save a solved equation
- [x] Load a previously saved equation
- [x] Dark Mode for better accessibility

## How it works üîç

This app is a frontend client for an AI-powered equation solver API. The goal is to make it easy for users to input various equations and formulas, and the AI will attempt to solve them.

Relevant formulas, laws, and concepts:
- Algebraic equations (e.g., quadratic, linear equations)
- Geometry theorems (e.g., Pythagoras theorem)
- Newton's laws of motion
- Chemical reaction balancing rules
- Matrix operations (for solving systems of equations)
## How to run üöÄ

It's simple to run; you will only need Node with npm or yarn installed and a web browser.

#### Clone this repo


```
git clone https://github.com/atharva-0123-cs/equations-slover.git
```

#### Then in the root of the project

```
npm install
```

This will install everything needed to run.

#### Finally, npm run dev 
```
npm run dev
```
Access http://localhost:3000 to see the result!
